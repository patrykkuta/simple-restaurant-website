# 👨🏻‍🍳 Simple Restaurant Website Project

A simple, multi-page restaurant website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. This was a **basic project** developed during my **first year** of studying Software Engineering, focused on foundational web development skills.

## 📚 About

This website simulates a restaurant's online presence, showcasing menu items and a company history section. It was designed using a modular approach, with reusable components such as a shared navigation bar, footer, and sidebar to ensure consistency across pages and make future updates easier to manage.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of each page
- **CSS3** – Custom styling across the site
- **JavaScript** – Front-end interactions (navigation, loading products)
- **PHP** – Page templating and partials
- **JSON** – Used to load product data dynamically

## 📁 Project Structure

```
index.php
|- css/
|- js/
|- html/
|- assets/
|  |- images/
|  |- fonts/
```

- `index.php`: The main landing page
- `css/`: The CSS stylesheets
- `html/`: Contains HTML/PHP partials (e.g., footer, menu)
- `js/`: Scripts for product loading and navigation
- `assets/`: Fonts, images, and JSON data

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Creating modular HTML/PHP structures
- Loading and displaying data using JavaScript
- Organizing web assets efficiently
- Combining static and server-side content

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/patrykkuta/restaurant-website.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd simple-restaurant-website
    ```
3. Run a local PHP server (if PHP is installed):
    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000
    ```
4. Open your browser and visit:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:8000
    ```

💡 You can also use tools like XAMPP, MAMP, or Laragon if you prefer a GUI-based local server.
